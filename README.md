# 📐 Polygon Collision Detection

My attempt at a rudimentary homemade collision detection engine without using any external libraries to help me (apart from Gosu to visualise, and mathn for trigonometry functions).

Create and move any regular polygon and detect when colliding.

I intend to extend this with other physics features like spring, bounce and thrust.
